	 	<p>Last year "fake news" gained an entry in the dictionary. 2017 was also the year I joined BBC News so I was happy to be working on the <a href="https://thetrustproject.org/">Trust Project</a> - an academia-led collaboration between news media organisations, social media platforms & search engines. The outcome was standards that help readers identify trust-worthy news.</p>

	 	<p>And then I went to talk about it in the Geek Girl Meetup 5th annual conference to realise how much hard work it is to be part of a panel with intelligent women. <br>But it did make me step out of my comfort zone and have to think on my feet. </p>

	 	<p>Earlier that year I participated in NASA's 2-day hackathon. We developed a prototype application for nervous flyers that utilises GPS reversing geo-code to produce a location and then display information to users about the landscape below the airplane. We built a 2D map that moves as deviceâ€™s latlongs change. You can find our pitch <a href="https://2017.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/earth-and-us/pilots-plus/teams/flycatcher/project">here</a> and our code in my github.</p>

	 	<p>After years of reading TfL's (Transport for London) digital blog, I was happy to join them in 2015 and work on a website that is responsible for getting millions of London commuters to work every day.<br>PS. This is also why I know that Waterloo is the busiest station and Angel has the longest escalator.</p>

	 	<p>One of the projects I worked on as a business analyst was the release of the first personalisation features to TfL website. At the time a very popular bus arrivals website was shut down but we managed to retain most of its bus users. I was responsible for the requirements analysis and ensuring we build and test the right thing. </p>

   <div class="whitecity">
	 	<p>I also conducted feasibility study to evaluate different options regarding the best way to alert drivers in London about upcoming planned traffic disruptions. After that I was responsible for delivering a new web, open-source mapping solution that used predicted traffic data. This solution saved 3 days every 2 weeks in internal work & reduced recurrent costs.</p>
